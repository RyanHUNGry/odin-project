    <h1>Anthony Davis providing Lakers exactly what they need: MVP-level performances</h1>
    <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) Anthony Davis had 30 points and 18 rebounds, and the Los Angeles Lakers beat the San Antonio Spurs <strong>123-92</strong> Sunday night to win three straight games for the first time since the first week of January.</p>
    <p>While LeBron James missed his fourth straight game with a left adductor strain, Davis came through with yet another prolific performance in his fellow superstar's absence, producing three straight 30-point games for the first time since March 2020. Austin Reaves also scored 17 of his season-high 21 points in the first half before the Lakers cruised to a victory that boosted the Pacific Division's worst record to 5-10.</p>
